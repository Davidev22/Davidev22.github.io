![Alt text for image](/about.jpeg)

My name is David Henriquez, I'm a 22-year-old web designer from Venezuela, passionate about building visually appealing and functional websites with WordPress. I started offering my services as a freelancer on [Fiverr](https://es.fiverr.com/s/EgyQREe), where I gained my first clients and hands-on experience.

Through Fiverr, I was contacted by a Canary Islands-based agency called Atlantic Consultores. At the time, I had no previous experience with WordPress, but I accepted the challenge and quickly dove into learning. The agency began assigning me real projects, and that experience allowed me to develop both my technical and design skills in a practical, professional environment.

Today, I continue to grow as a WordPress specialist, focusing on delivering websites that are not only beautiful and user-friendly but also optimized for performance and tailored to each client's needs.

## Skills and Expertise

I specialize in front-end and back-end development, utilizing the latest technologies to build responsive and user-friendly websites. My proficiency includes **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and frameworks such as **Astro.js** for dynamic and interactive user interfaces. On the server side, I'm well-versed in Node.js and have experience with database management systems like MongoDB.

## Innovation and Problem-Solving

I thrive on solving complex problems and transforming ideas into functional, elegant websites. Whether it's optimizing performance, implementing new features, or troubleshooting issues, I approach each challenge with enthusiasm and a commitment to delivering high-quality solutions.

## Global Perspective, Local Impact

Living in Estonia has not only influenced my appreciation for nature and culture but has also shaped my approach to web development. I understand the importance of creating digital solutions that resonate with local audiences while maintaining a global perspective.

## Continuous Learning

The dynamic nature of the tech industry inspires me to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and advancements. I'm always eager to expand my skill set and embrace emerging technologies that enhance the functionality and aesthetics of the websites I create.

## Collaboration and Communication

I believe in the power of collaboration and effective communication. Whether working with clients, designers, or fellow developers, I value clear communication to ensure the success of every project.
