My name is David Henriquez, I'm a 22-year-old web designer from Venezuela, passionate about building visually appealing and functional websites with WordPress. I started offering my services as a freelancer on [Fiverr](https://es.fiverr.com/s/EgyQREe), where I gained my first clients and hands-on experience.

Through Fiverr, I was contacted by a Canary Islands-based agency called Atlantic Consultores. At the time, I had no previous experience with WordPress, but I accepted the challenge and quickly dove into learning. The agency began assigning me real projects, and that experience allowed me to develop both my technical and design skills in a practical, professional environment.

Today, I continue to grow as a WordPress specialist, focusing on delivering websites that are not only beautiful and user-friendly but also optimized for performance and tailored to each client's needs.
