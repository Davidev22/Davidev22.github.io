**Note:** This case study is entirely fictional and created for the purpose of showcasing [Florelia.org](https://florelia.org/).

**Project Overview:**
Florelia is an interactive and visually striking web platform born from a collaboration with Disash, a brand that creates t-shirts inspired by fictional urban districts. The project artistically represents three imaginary zones: Region C, Region D, and Region E, through a digital design that blends urban aesthetics with visual storytelling.

The website serves as an exhibition space highlighting the creative essence of each region, featuring:

A dynamic gallery showcasing Disash's designs.

Intuitive navigation between the different zones.

Graphic and typographic elements that reinforce each region’s unique identity.


## Objectives

1. Showcase the Collaboration with Disash

Present the joint work between Florelia and Disash as an experimental design project.

2. Promote the Fictional Regions Concept

Use the website to communicate the inspiration behind Regions C, D, and E.

3. Create an Immersive Experience

Develop interactions and visuals that immerse users in these imaginary urban landscapes.

4. Strengthen the Project’s Visual Identity

Ensure color palettes, typography, and graphics reflect Florelia’s urban and artistic spirit.
